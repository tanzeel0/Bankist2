## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Provides dynamic functionality and user interactions.

## How It Works
1. **Login**: The user logs in using a predefined username and PIN. The app checks these credentials before granting access to the user's account.
2. **View Balance**: Upon logging in, users are presented with their current balance, which dynamically updates as transactions occur.
3. **Transfer Money**: Users can transfer funds by entering the recipientâ€™s username and the amount to send.
4. **Request Loan**: Users can apply for a loan, which is instantly credited to their account if the conditions are met.
5. **Close Account**: Users can close their account by providing their username and PIN.
6. **Auto Logout**: For security reasons, the user is logged out after a period of inactivity.

## UI Design
The Bankist2 website is designed with a clean, minimalist aesthetic. It is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. Key UI features include:
- **Navbar**: Fixed at the top with smooth scrolling links.
- **Login Form**: Centered on the page for quick access.
- **User Dashboard**: Displays the user's balance and transaction history in a visually appealing format.
- **Transaction Details**: Each transaction is color-coded (green for deposits, red for withdrawals) to improve readability.
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle animations enhance the user experience, from the login transition to the button hover effects.
